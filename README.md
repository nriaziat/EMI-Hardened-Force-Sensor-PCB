## Key concepts

For more information about this project, please refer to our publication: (TODO).
Designed for use with the Texas Measurment [QMFLA-5-350-11-1LJAY-F](https://tml.jp/e/product/strain_gauge/mf_list.html) and the [RP2040](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040/).
For maximum EMI resistance, we reccommend using twisted and shielded cabling as well as the included 3D printed housing with copper tape lining. 

## Project expectations

* The design has been manufactured and tested. Board was ordered through OSH Park and hand assembled.
